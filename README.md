<h1 style="text-align: center;">Thank you for your interest in Clever Cloud!</h1>

At Clever Cloud, we want to rethink what a Cloud Service Provider should be for businesses and developers around the world. We deal with complexity so that our customers don’t have to. Our mission is simple: Build a powerful, versatile yet simple to use, Cloud Platform.

**We are looking for engineers who share our mission.**

<br/>

Our most deeply held engineering belief is in the deep understanding of technology. Mastering a domain area can be a life challenge, and there isn’t always a clear path to solve a problem. As if that weren’t enough, we believe that true magic happens when hardware and software are designed to work with one another. Generally speaking, deep understanding is key for good engineering designs.

**We are looking for engineers who like to solve hard problems.**

<br/>

At Clever Cloud, we have simple values we think are important to work together. Differences between people are the driver to an open mindset which turns to be key to engineering: surpass our own belief, understand alternative ways of thinking or rethink the status quo.

**We are looking for engineers who share our values.**

<br/>

We believe that the best basis for assessment of an engineer is not through their performance on an arbitrary oral exam, but rather through their own expression.  That’s why we use interviews to deeply understand the complete engineer who your work indicates you to be.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Questionnaire</h2>


Please answer the following questions, using as much space as you need. All of these questions are important, but the final question is probably the most important one; take your time in answering it!

_What work have you found most technically challenging in your career and why?_

> During my studies, I faced the challenge of programming an electronic device comprising a microcontroller and three different sensors. The major challenge lay in optimizing the program, which was initially too complex for the microcontroller's capabilities. Determined to integrate all the planned functionalities, I had to optimize resource usage and memory management. This led me to delve into complex technical documentation and to deeply understand the microcontroller's specifics. I also learned to use debugging tools to diagnose issues in my program and profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks. I had to be rigorous in adhering to strict technical constraints and curious in mastering new tools to solve unprecedented problems. Despite facing significant complexity, I found solutions to achieve my goals without compromising the original vision.

_What work have you done that you were particularly proud of and why?_

> SmartCampus is an innovative project designed by my university institute, aimed at managing the ambiance within classroom spaces of our building. Data acquisition systems have been installed in each room to measure temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels. This information is transmitted via an HTTP POST request to a REST API, which records it in a database. A web application then allows real-time visualization of this data and offers personalized recommendations to room users, based on the collected measurements. For example, if the temperature exceeds a certain threshold, the application suggests opening windows for ventilation. A designated administrator can monitor this information through a dashboard, displaying data in the form of tables and graphs, enabling efficient management of the ambiance in each room.

_When have you been happiest in your professional career and why?_

> I am happiest when I am working on projects that I am passionate about. A project that appeals to me is one that is useful, either by improving a company's performance or by contributing to the improvement of people's daily lives. Recently, I have found great satisfaction in my work because I had the opportunity to focus on an aspect that particularly interests me, and I was able to learn new things independently.

_When have you been unhappiest in your professional career and why?_

> Sometimes, especially at the beginning of the semester, I find some classes boring. This sense of boredom mainly stems from the fact that, although theoretical courses are important, they fail to capture my attention. I am someone who needs practical experiences. Experimenting and learning by doing are the aspects of the learning process that I prefer. Therefore, I feel less motivated when the courses offer few practical opportunities.

_Regarding CleverCloud's values, is there any that you oppose?_

> No, I share the values of CleverCloud.

_For a pair of CleverCloud's values, describe a time in which the two values came into tension for you or your work, and how you resolved it._

> My curiosity sometimes clashed with my rigor. For instance, I faced technical difficulties due to a lack of knowledge in certain areas. To address this, I devoted time to deepen my understanding in these subjects. However, I often found myself engrossed in learning new concepts, which detracted from the time allocated to my projects. Ultimately, although I resolved the encountered issues, I exceeded the initially set deadlines. This experience taught me to reassess my organization in order to manage my time with greater rigor.

_What do you think should be improved on our product?_

> Your products are amazing! However, I think it would be interesting to make them even more accessible to people who are not familiar with the cloud. By improving the user journey and making the interface more intuitive, you could attract a broader audience. One suggestion would be to implement a system of tutorial videos for new users.

_Why do you want to work for CleverCloud?_

> I am eager to complete my internship at CleverCloud for several reasons. First and foremost, I am convinced that CleverCloud is a company where I can flourish professionally. As a French company with fresh ambitions, it would be an incredible opportunity for me to start my career alongside you. CleverCloud offers services to both businesses and individuals, making their lives easier, which aligns perfectly with my passion for developing innovative solutions. Moreover, I am drawn to the company's culture, which upholds values that are dear to me. I am confident that I have much to learn at CleverCloud and am motivated by the prospect of contributing to your mission.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Work samples</h2>

<br/>

The ultimate measure of an engineer is our work. Please submit between one to three work samples, providing links if/as necessary. This should be work that best reflects you as an engineer -- work that you are proud of or you feel is otherwise representative of who you aspire to be as an engineer. If this work is entirely proprietary, please describe it as fully as you can, providing necessary context.

_Work(s) sample(s)_

I will describe two projects that I have completed and am proud of. All these works were done using GITlab on the forge of my university. This is why there is no activity on my GitHub account.

Let's start with the SmartCampus project. 

This project was entrusted to us by the city of La Rochelle, aimed at reducing unnecessary energy consumption and improving students' working conditions. We implemented a system of sensors that measure temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels in classrooms. These data are then sent to a REST API (Framework: API Platform, PHP) which stores them in a database (MySQL). Finally, a web application (Framework: Symfony, PHP) allows real-time visualization of these data and provides tailored recommendations to the room users, based on the captured values. For instance, if the temperature is too high, the application suggests opening the windows. 

Three personas were identified in this project: Users, the Mission Manager, and the Technician. Each has a well-defined role and specific functionalities. Two personal spaces are accessible, one for the Mission Manager and one for the Technician. The Mission Manager has access to a dashboard for visualizing data through tables and charts (JavaScript), and can request the Technician for the installation of new sensors. The Technician's dashboard allows them to view current sensors and the Mission Manager's requests, and to install new sensors in the classrooms.

Web application developed with Symfony framework -> [GitHub link](https://github.com/Bonnemine-dev/SmartCampus)

**Features**
- Login system for personal spaces
- Mission Manager’s personal space:
  - Global data visualization (averages, trends, etc.)
  - Room-specific data visualization
  - Sensor status display for a selected room
  - History of data feedback, archives, and temperature, humidity, and CO2 level charts
  - Request panel for installing new sensors
- Technician’s personal space:
  - Visualization of installed sensors and their status
  - Viewing Mission Manager’s requests
  - Ability to register new sensors in the database
- User space (public area):
  - Project explanation page
  - Option to search for a classroom for its recommendations
  - QR code scanning in the room for quick recommendations

Data acquisition system developed in C++ with Arduino framework -> [GitHub link](https://github.com/Bonnemine-dev/SmartCampus-Sensors)

**Features**
- Data capturing and data quality check through a filtering algorithm
- Data sending via WIFI and HTTP POST requests to a REST API
- Access to a captive portal (like in airports) for device configuration (SSID, password, IP address, etc.)
- Anomaly detection and device status display via an LED
- Automatic night-time standby mode for energy saving
- Code optimization for minimal energy consumption
- Data recording in case of connection loss

This project developed my skills in: PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C++, SQL, REST APIs, GIT, Symfony, Profiling, Networking, Autonomy, Teamwork, etc.

Another project I am proud of is CharcloBross, a video game inspired by arcade games and MarioBros. The objective of the game is simple: to accumulate as many points as possible. In this platform game, we play as a beggar. Our character defeats enemies by jumping on them and can also collect coins to boost his performance. The game was developed in C++ with QT Creator.

<ins>Writing samples</ins>

We have found that the engineers that we like to work with tend to value the written word. What’s an example of writing that you are proud of?  This writing can take a variety of forms, e.g.: \




* A block comment in source code
* A blog entry or other long-form post on a technical issue
* A technical architecture document, design document, specification, whitepaper or academic paper

Please submit at least one writing sample (and no more than three) that you feel represents you, providing links if/as necessary.


_Writing sample(s)_

When we developed the SmartCampus project, we also decided to create a wiki to explain how the project works and to track its progress. This wiki can be accessed at the following address: https://github.com/Bonnemine-dev/SmartCampus/wiki
We also used Miro to record our ideas. Miro primarily served as a draft for us, but it enabled us to visualize our ideas and share them with other group members. You can view our Miro board here: [Miro board](https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/azdnSjhLdFZNcXpMenUyeU1LUmNsTlVLSUFCN2VFT2dQUHhyMFgxN0NtYVpSRWljMnF4VmxxSERVb3VUTG91aXwzNDU4NzY0NTMzMzQ5Mzc5OTcwfDI=?share_link_id=785320243310)
I also created a user manual for the sensor we developed. You can find this manual here: [ici](https://github.com/Bonnemine-dev/SmartCampus-Sensors/blob/40b850b6d2dcd0b1091bbbd7cbeda0cba0075a8f/Mode-emploie.pdf)

<ins>Analysis samples</ins>

A significant challenge of engineering is dealing with a system when it doesn't, in fact, work correctly.  When systems misbehave, engineers must flip their disposition:  instead of a creator of their own heaven and earth, they must become a scientist, attempting to reason about a foreign world. Please provide an analysis sample: a written analysis of system misbehavior from some point in your career. If such an analysis is not readily available (as it might not be if one’s work has been strictly proprietary), please recount an incident in which you analyzed system misbehavior, including as much technical detail as you can recall.


_Analysis sample(s)_

<ins>Presentation samples</ins>

Especially as engineers become more senior, oral presentation of work becomes an important vehicle for communication. If you have given a technical presentation that is publicly available, please provide a link to the slides (and the video if available).  Engineers are often also very self-conscious about their presentations, so don’t worry about any imperfections — and don’t be concerned if it’s brief or informal! If you don’t have a publicly available presentation, please describe a topic on which you have presented in the past.


_Presentation sample(s)_

When we successfully complete a project like those mentioned earlier, we are required to deliver it to the client once it is finished. To do this, we start by reviewing the key points of the specifications with the client, and then we proceed with a demonstration of the product. This demonstration requires careful preparation to decide which elements to present and in what order, to avoid confusing the client during our presentation. We explain the features, technical choices, challenges encountered, and solutions provided, among other things. Finally, we answer the client's questions. This exercise demands precision, clarity, and pedagogical skills. It is a task I particularly enjoy, as it allows showcasing the work done and seeing the client's satisfaction.
