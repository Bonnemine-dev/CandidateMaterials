<h1 style="text-align: center;">Thank you for your interest in Clever Cloud!</h1>

At Clever Cloud, we want to rethink what a Cloud Service Provider should be for businesses and developers around the world. We deal with complexity so that our customers don’t have to. Our mission is simple : Build a powerful, versatile yet simple to use, Cloud Platform.

**We are looking for engineers who share our mission.**

Our most deeply held engineering belief is in the deep understanding of technology. Mastering a domain area can be a life challenge, and there isn’t always a clear path to solve a problem. As if that weren’t enough, we believe that true magic happens when hardware and software are designed to work with one another. Generally speaking, deep understanding is key for good engineering designs.

**We are looking for engineers who like to solve hard problems.**

At Clever Cloud, we have simple values we think are important to work together. Differences between people are the driver to an open mindset which turns to be key to engineering : surpass our own belief, understand alternative ways of thinking or rethink the status quo.

**We are looking for engineers who share our values.**

We believe that the best basis for assessment of an engineer is not through their performance on an arbitrary oral exam, but rather through their own expression.  That’s why we use interviews to deeply understand the complete engineer who your work indicates you to be.

You should find that these candidate materials will take no more than a couple of hours to gather; please fork or copy this document, and for each section, please use the space provided, expanding into additional pages as necessary. When completed, please export this document as a PDF and submit it with your application.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Work samples</h2>

The ultimate measure of an engineer is our work. Please submit between one to three work samples, providing links if/as necessary. This should be work that best reflects you as an engineer -- work that you are proud of or you feel is otherwise representative of who you aspire to be as an engineer. If this work is entirely proprietary, please describe it as fully as you can, providing necessary context.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Writing samples</span>

We have found that the engineers that we like to work with tend to value the written word. What’s an example of writing that you are proud of?  This writing can take a variety of forms, e.g.: \




* A block comment in source code
* A blog entry or other long-form post on a technical issue
* A technical architecture document, design document, specification, whitepaper or academic paper

Please submit at least one writing sample (and no more than three) that you feel represents you, providing links if/as necessary.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Analysis samples</span>

A significant challenge of engineering is dealing with a system when it doesn't, in fact, work correctly.  When systems misbehave, engineers must flip their disposition:  instead of a creator of their own heaven and earth, they must become a scientist, attempting to reason about a foreign world. Please provide an analysis sample: a written analysis of system misbehavior from some point in your career. If such an analysis is not readily available (as it might not be if one’s work has been strictly proprietary), please recount an incident in which you analyzed system misbehavior, including as much technical detail as you can recall.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Presentation samples</span>

Especially as engineers become more senior, oral presentation of work becomes an important vehicle for communication. If you have given a technical presentation that is publicly available, please provide a link to the slides (and the video if available).  Engineers are often also very self-conscious about their presentations, so don’t worry about any imperfections — and don’t be concerned if it’s brief or informal! If you don’t have a publicly available presentation, please describe a topic on which you have presented in the past. \

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Questionnaire</h2>


Please answer the following questions, using as much space as you need. All of these questions are important, but the final question is probably the most important one; take your time in answering it!

_What work have you found most technically challenging in your career and why?_

_What work have you done that you were particularly proud of and why?_

_When have you been happiest in your professional career and why?_

_When have you been unhappiest in your professional career and why?_

_For one of CleverCloud's values, describe an example of how it was reflected in a particular body of your work._

_For one of CleverCloud's values, describe an example of how it was violated in your organization or work._

_For a pair of CleverCloud's values, describe a time in which the two values came into tension for you or your work, and how you resolved it._
